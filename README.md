# Image-Quantization-using-Machine-Learning

Color quantization is a process that involves several key steps to reduce the number of colors in an image while maintaining its overall appearance.

Main Steps Involves:

Color space analysis : Examine the colors present in the original image to understand their distribution and frequency.

Palette selection : Choose a target color palette with fewer colors, using algorithms that consider color distribution and visual perception factors.

Color clustering : Group similar colors in the original image, assigning them a representative color from the selected palette.

Color mapping : Replace the original colors in the image with their corresponding representative colors from the reduced palette, minimizing visual differences between the original and quantized images.
